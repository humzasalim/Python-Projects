hexapawn.py:

a hexapawn game coded with machine learning algorithms

perceptron.py:

an implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm. The perceptron is a simple machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. It takes a set of inputs, applies weights to them, and compares the result to a threshold to make a binary decision (0 or 1). If the prediction does not match the expected answer, it adjusts the weights to improve future predictions.
